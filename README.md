## Overview

The `WithdrawalManager` is an upgradable contract used by the Maple V2 protocol to facilitate withdrawals of liquidity from a Maple pool via a cyclical withdrawal mechanism. It also enables pro-rata distribution of cash in the event of insufficient liquidity.

For more information about the `WithdrawalManager` contract in the context of the Maple V2 protocol, please refer to the Withdrawal section of the protocol [wiki](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core-v2/wiki/Withdrawal-Mechanism).

## Dependencies/Inheritance

Contracts in this repo inherit and import code from:
- [`maple-labs/erc20`](https://github.com/maple-labs/erc20)
- [`maple-labs/erc20-helper`](https://github.com/maple-labs/erc20-helper)
- [`maple-labs/maple-proxy-factory`](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-proxy-factory)

Contracts inherit and import code in the following ways:
- `WithdrawalManager` uses `ERC20Helper` for token interactions.
- `WithdrawalManager` inherits `MapleProxiedInternals` for proxy logic.
- `WithdrawalManagerFactory` inherits `MapleProxyFactory` for proxy deployment and management.

Versions of dependencies can be checked with `git submodule status`.
